Web scraping in Python involves extracting data from websites. Here's a basic outline of how you can use this script in Python:

1) Choose a Library: Python has several libraries for web scraping. BeautifulSoup and requests are commonly used together. Scrapy is another powerful framework if you need more advanced capabilities.

2) Install Libraries: If you haven't already installed these libraries, you can do so using pip:
```
pip install beautifulsoup4 requests

pip install requests --upgrade

```
3) Run the code by imputing this in the terminal
```
python webscraper.py
```
4) Copy the link of iOS App Store Page

```
Ryan's iOS Store Web Scrapper V1.0

Enter the link to the app store page: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voidpet-garden-mental-health/id1668932264
Data saved successfully to info\app_data.json.
```
5) Now the script will scrap the data and store it in the info folder as a .json
