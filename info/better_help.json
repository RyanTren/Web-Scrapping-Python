            "Review": "Iâd been putting off finding a therapist because I was sifting through local recommendations and not finding a good match. Then I joined BetterHelp, answered a few questions, and was paired with a fantastic therapist within minutes. Thatâs the most important part and BetterHelp nailed it. The platform itself is well-designed and strong at facilitating communication with your therapist. Weâve shared links, worksheets, documents and more. Itâs also super-convenient having the secure chat and video sessions happen right on the page (for desktop/laptop) or right in the app (for phone). It can run a bit much if youâre used to twice-a-month sessions but Iâve found (that and my therapist has encouraged) once-a-week sessions are both better for my mental health and make me feel like Iâm getting the most bang for my buck. You can even do more than that, plus chat anytime, if you feel you need it.For those who may be new to cognitive behavioral therapy, know that it can be daunting and you may not connect with your first therapist. BetterHelp makes it easy to get a new one if thatâs the caseâand you should never feel guilty about moving on. A good therapist will understand and want you with someone who is a better fit, too. With that said, the more you can come into this experience with an open mind and a healing spirit, the more youâll get out of it. Just focus on your mental health and BetterHelp will be there to help with the rest."

            "Review": "I have been using better help for over a year now. First let me say that my therapist is the best one Iâve ever had. Iâve been seeing therapist since I was 14 years of age. Iâve had a therapist who forced me to exercise/calorie restriction at the age of 14. Iâve had another who didnât see my mothers abuse. Iâve had others who just didnât want to work with someone with my severity of issues. At some point I stopped going to therapy because it felt like rejection. It felt like no one could ever help me. I had seen ads about BetterHelp. I always put it off. However, my life began to flash before my eyes and I had enough. So I started BetterHelp when I was 21 years old. She is a black woman which is always such a rarity because trauma within the black community looks vastly different than trauma from other communities. Within the last year Iâve experienced great financial challenges and still am. I was almost homeless, lost my job, and my ESA had an emergency. I reached out to them because of these financial issues and they were able to provide me financial aid. Which has been really beneficial since I now get to continue therapy. I still am jobless and am trying to survive the best I can. However, with my therapist help Iâve still remained resilient. My therapist has been able to help me recognize a lot of abuse/trauma and has given me the tools to do better. She holds me accountable whilst also being kind and supportive. Thank you BetterHelp!"

            "Review": "I appreciate this company and their support has been great. After trying Talkspace, I came to them and wanted to try them out, but didn't qualify for more than 5% financial aid, and they gave me 40% after learning that I had shelled' out for their competitor. It took me several tries, because some clinicians didn't respond or wrote very short replies, or (in one case), asked what I wanted out of therapy when I'd written a pretty detailed response to the initial questionnaire. After working with my clinician for several months, I canceled my account. I had to start the process over again, but when I reached out to support, they told me I could get back to working with the clinician I liked, and my session history was restored, just as if I'd never left. This clinician is great, too. His name is Lance Tingle, and he provides Thankful Thursdays and Mindfulness Monday exercises, along with the therapy. He is quick to respond, and he provides exercises, app recommendations, and articles to read. If you keep at it and find a clinician whom you trust and are able to work with, this can be a really great app. You have the means to write about your experiences on-the-go, so you can process things as they come up. Cancellation is a bit of a convoluted process since you have to click Cancel several times, and make sure you get the cancellation E-mail. Other than this, I highly recommend the company and its services."
