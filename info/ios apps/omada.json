            "Review": "I donât leave a lot of reviews for many things, but need to for Omadaâ¦!  As my title statedâ¦ Omada Simply Worksâ¦!  I have been on the program for over a year, I am 49 years old and have lost 65+ lbs to date.  I found Omada through work and joined and my life has changed completely.  My success has also tuned other co-workers onto Omada as well. I have eaten healthier meals and more fruits and vegetables with Omada than I probably have my entire life.  The lessons are invaluable and the greatest thing with Omada, is your coach.  Mine has been a Godsend and she has guided me from day #1.  I have had weeks where I lost a few pounds and weeks where I gained.  Weeks where I lost nothing.  But consistency is what it teaches and it also teaches that while not every meal may be perfect, itâs the mindset that it puts you in that brings you success. When I started I was around 315 and am now in the 240âs with more to go.  I have tried other weight loss programs and nothing worked for me.  Omada has and I will praise it as I feel finding Omada saved my life.  I was feeling so low physically and mentally that I didnât think I would live to see 50.  Omada changed that.  God Bless you for an amazing program."

            "Review": "This app and the Omada program have taught me so much, stuff doctors and the internet canât teach. After going through the program I can assure you I feel more confident about making healthier choices. The information provided and the support from the coach is impeccable. They are here to help and they do. The group can either be supportive or not. If you do this go all in, the program doesn't aim to fix you immediately or make extremely drastic changes asap. They go in stages. They do it because it works. Focus on something one week, build it into your routine and keep building. I feel significantly healthier and I see results. My group wasnât the most dedicated, but I got what I needed and I have a way to go. The program changed my life and helped me get out of a rut and actually see results. Will you fail some point yes, I did. You stick with it you will see results. Tracking is key, I understand why, its basic science experiment. Establish a baseline, keep that baseline and understand the changes based on your tracking. Figure out what your doing that caused the change and you will. Tracking is everything."

            "Review": "My health insurance offered me this planned at no cost to me. So I signed up and it has been a life-changing experience. At first not many pounds came off, but the change in how I felt made it all worthwhile and I kept going forward with the weekly lessons because I just felt so good. I dropped 60 points in my blood pressure which put me down into a normal range for the first time in my adult life. Along with blood pressure medication and lifestyle changes on this plan. my hips no longer hurt while Iâm walking. I dropped a pant size without even much loss on the scale. I sleep better; for the first time in 30 years Iâm getting a good nights sleep. And all of this is happening without counting calories, but making lifestyle changesBoth physical and mental. It is helping me so much in all areas of my life. Who knew when I signed up that this plan was more about a whole life improvement rather than just dropping a few pounds on a scale. And now that Iâve changed my physical and mental health the pounds are starting to drop and the scale is my friend again"
