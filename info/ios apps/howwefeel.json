Conceived in conjunction with Yale University's Center for Emotional Intelligence and based on the work of Dr Marc Brackett, How We Feel helps people find the right word to describe how they feel while tracking their sleep, exercise, and health trends using HealthKit in order to spot patterns over time.Founded as a science-based nonprofit, How We Feel is made possible by donations from people who are passionate about bringing mental wellbeing to the widest possible audience. Our data privacy terms are clear and easy-to-understand: all of your data is kept on your device unless you opt-in to send an anonymized version of your check-ins to be used in research to help more people.Whether you are downloading this app in order to build better relationships, make your emotions to work for you, not against you, improve how you handle stress and anxiety or simply to feel better, How We Feel will help you identify patterns through daily HealthKit tracking and find emotional regulation strategies that will work for you. The How We Feel friends feature allows you to share how you feel with the people you trust most in real time, strengthening your most important relationships.Filled with step-by-step video strategies you can do in as little as one minute on themes like \"Change Your Thinking\" to help you address negative thought patterns with cognitive strategies; \"Move Your Body\" to express and release emotions through movement strategies;\"Be Mindful\" to gain perspective and minimize the negative impact of misunderstood emotions with mindfulness strategies; \"Reach Out\" to build intimacy and trust, two important tools for emotional wellbeing, with social strategies.",

            "Review": "I have been absolutely loving this app, from the beginning the tone and language used is welcoming, warm, supportive and encouraging. I am a designer myself and I find the majority of apps are functional but devoid of character and this app maintains the ease of use (and even facilitates it) with a lot of character that makes reporting my feelings fun even when Iâm not feeling like anything would be fun, the playfulness and abstraction in no way takes away from the experience and the human descriptions in the videos are so calm and purely helpful that they are not threatening the way self-improvement videos can be. They donât make me feel bad for not having done a suggestion, just optimistic that I can see benefits from trying it.My main point of improvement is that I have input a sizable number of check-ins on my iPad and others on my iPhone and although the two apps appear to be sharing the same identifier they donât compile the data to get the full picture and that would be a huge improvement for me since I canât easily compare the times that I am using one or the other. I looked for a way to export my data and import it to the other device(the long route) but I didnât find anything, ultimately the best solution would be automatic sync. Keep up the great work!"

            "Review": "I love the simple design of How We Feel. The matrix of emotion words is really helpful and easy to use, I find it much easier to just open the app and log my emotions than to journal. The best part of the app is that all of the features are actually completely free, the lessons on understanding your emotions, de-stressing exercises, emotion word matrix, additional journaling features, and mood analysis are all free and there are no subscriptions to be seen. I really recommend How We Feel to anyone who already likes journaling and mindfulness, who is like me and is very bad at forming new habits, or just anyone who feels curious about understanding their own emotions better. The analysis tab lets you look at all your logged moods over time so you can start to see patterns emerge. Do you log being fatigued more often when you have a big project youâre working on? Do you log more positive emotions in summer and spring than winter and fall? Would also be useful for anyone starting on mental health recovery who would like to track their progress over time. Overall wonderful completely free app with tons of features you can use at your own pace."
