            "Review": "Thank you for this wonderful site made of love and volunteerism. I have tried for a year to access groups and articles. The more I saw, the more support I saw I could receive and provide to others, the harder I tried to wait until later to access broken links or to open the app at all, or to work on the website where I filled in Join questionnaires over and over, only to be maddeningly unable to fully access the submit button and join in. My phone and computer are fairly new with up-to-date operating systems. Iâm reasonably adept as an operator. Iâve tried to open the website on my computer and have been unable to access my correct profile and saved information. I receive tantalizing emails with so much promise to comfort, only to see The Mightyâs screen page freeze my phone, and after reinstalling, rebooting my phone for months, I am so frustrated, trying to use the Mighty is wasting my time, alienating me, driving me crazy, actually harming me. It seems certain to me that you must be at least somewhat aware of the grave technical problems on the site. I would like you to know how they are affecting an individual and likely many others. I donât want to give up, but itâs getting to the point that I might have to. Thank you again for the amazing project that is the Mighty. If this is the best it can be, I completely understand."

            "Review": "I love this app SO much. It provides such a safe place to just be yourself, and express your pain. At first I assumed it was for people with depression, anxiety, and just things like that, but they have things that I have never even heard of! They even have chats and stuff for people with Lyme disease. The only thing is, I have an iPad, and this app doesnât go to landscape. And, even when vertical (which is always), it wonât let you see the full paragraph of peoples replyâs and such. There is no âread moreâ button or anything like that. You can constantly tap, swipe, or hold, but no matter what I do it wonât let me see things like peoples replies in posts. I donât know if people have the same problem on a phone, but using this app on an iPad can be a little bit frustrating at times. Besides that, this is such a great app and I highly suggest downloading it. I doubt that the creators will ever see this, but if they are, I can not express my gratitude enough for giving people going through depression, anxiety, PTSD, etc.. a safe place to be expressive and be able to ask for help and/or advice. Oh! I am also receiving notifications outside the app, but when I do later go on the app those notifications wonât be in my notifications."

I think that it is exactly what Facebook should have been or maybe hoped to do in the beginning is to connect people that felt alone and I think itâs so badly needed especially because our countryâs broken medical health system! Thank you to âThe mighty!â Creators and participators for giving people a place to go when they feel like theyâre alone lost in our medical system youâre my heroes!!!!ð¤©ð¥³ð¥°"
