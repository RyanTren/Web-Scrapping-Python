            "Review": "I have followed this game since near the beginning when it was only accessible through discord. Iâve been so excited for the app to come out. So far the app is outstanding. The ratio of cost to currency obtainability is balanced, all the voidpets are unique, and all the little features are so fun. I love that you can take care of your little tress and they attract new pets. The only thing that I donât like is that there isnât an option to explore the world and battle with your pets yet, but itâs okay because the game seems like itâs still in itâs development stages. I bought the yearly subscription, too. I donât think itâs necessarily worth it so far because of the fact that items you get from it arenât too outstanding yet, but I wanted to support the development of the game and this is a great and affordable way to do so. So far Iâve had a lot of fun with this game and the meditation and goal setting features are great. I will say, I also really donât see much of my starter (Venus, the envy) anymore and it makes me sad. I hope that the developers add a way to at least recall your starter to your land so you can interact with them more. But again, this game is outstanding. Great work! So worth the wait :))UPDATE: I donât know if this is a bug but I noticed that Rejection does not have a description and all the other voidpets Iâve collected do. Is this a bug?"

            "Review": "I absolutely love this game and I am so happy about all of the extra changes it has gone through since downloading the app. I have nothing to complain about but I did have a question. I was curious about the plants and when you make them vivid. I was wondering if the vivid effect does anything in attracting different types of pets. I noticed how once I made the plants vivid it didnât seem to change the type or rarity of the void pets it attracted. It would be super cool if it did have those types of effects though. I was also wondering if there were any other ways to get the gem type currency. The only way I have discovered so far is from finding a new thing that pets like and I think you get them from winning battles but idk. If there was a way to seek out and win specifically gems and not void matter that would amazing. I was also curious about whether or not there would be 2 new plants added. The reason I ask is because we have 3 plants already designated to metal, wood, and fire so I was wondering if we would get two more plants one for water and one for earth. Overall love the game though and canât wait to see how it evolves in the future!"

            "Review": "I love this game and am a daily player even almost a month into having the app, which is rare as far as self-care/mental health apps go. If youâre into collecting and battling with your emotions, youâll feel very rewarded with several main aspects of this game. If you came here to engage in self-care, you can engage in real-life self-care activities to help your garden grow. Unfortunately, you can only do the self-care activities once a day, and they are very brief. I would love to see the ability to engage in self-care activities multiple times a day added - even if it only benefits your garden the first time a day. Perhaps an added section of the menu where you can pick the voidpet youâd like to do self-care alongside? Iâd love to be able to meditate with a longer guided meditation, too. Overall a really fun and cute app, which could reach wider appeal in the mental health community with expanded functionality for self-care activities. I love the direction the app is going with adding an expanded journaling function, please keep it up!"
