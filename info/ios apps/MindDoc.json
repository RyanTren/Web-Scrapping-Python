            "Review": "This app is the best thing ever, no joke. I have so many things going on in my life that could make me sad or happy, and as a very sensitive person, I was very overwhelmed and confused about how it was affecting my mental health. I always thought I was mildly depressed. I took a bunch of online quizzes and they all looked the same but gave me different results. A couple said I was clear, and a couple said I had mild depression. At this point I had no idea what to do or what to think, and I knew I wanted some real answers, pronto. I felt like a psychologist was a lot of money, and all I really wanted to hear was if Iâm depressed or not. So, I looked up the app store for help thinking âthereâs gotta be an app for this!â And then Moodpath was the first result. I checked it out, great reviews, completely free, so I got it. Itâs been about 2 months now, and Iâm in love. The 15-day results are a great schedule, and there is a reasonable amount of notifications, 3 times a day to answer questions describing your mood. I got real results in no time at all, for no charge. This app truly gave me some hope for myself and for others who need it because itâs really amazing and relieving. I think as long as youâre honest and you answer questions 3 times a day, this app will turn out perfect for you. Very pleased with this app and thanks so much to its creatorsâ¤ï¸â¤ï¸"

            "Review": "Iâve struggled with Bipolar 2 disorder which I only recently was diagnosed with. Therefore, Iâm still trying to understand my experiences and my condition. My psychiatrist encouraged me to keep a âmoodâ journal, and referred me to this app. All I can say, is thank you Moodpath. Youâve helped me immensely in terms of keeping track of my thoughts, emotions, feelings, and everything in between. I highly recommend using this app to keep track of your emotions and daily experiences. The app even offers some âcoursesâ and tools to help with different coping strategies (which I have yet to try), but the fact that the option is available makes the app that much more worth a try. Although some of the courses arenât free to utilize, I anticipate myself signing up for Moodpath Plus for those extra features soon. I wish more people know about this company, because the creators seem to really care about people struggling with any kind of psychological problems. And even if you donât, itâs still interesting to see how in depth Moodpath assesses your everyday experiences! Again, thank you so much for helping me map out and organize what Iâm feeling every day."

            "Review": "4.3This app has a lot of useful information to help people understand the thoughts in their head. With great information on what depression is, the symptoms, and the treatment that all are based on factual information that I have learned in my college psychology classes. This app, developed by a group of experts in psychology can be used for many different things like keeping track of how you felt on a certain day as it gives you reminders to get into the app and let them know how you feel every morning, evening and night. You also will receive and assessment every 14 days of your emotional health that is based off your daily journal. This process repeats itself so you are able to track your progress. I am a big fan of the different âcoursesâ that you can take and learn about that also give you exercises to help with what you learned in that course. There is a lot of upside to this app and it can feel like and easier route then actually seeing a psychologist especially with the scientific accuracy and detail this app can give. But, I wouldnât substitute it for a real psychologist especially if you are experiencing severe symptoms. But overall this is a great app to help you log how you feel and learn information about depression that you would be able to learn in a psychology class."
