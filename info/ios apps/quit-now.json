            "Review": "I rate the app 5* because I have tried to quit literally 00s of times with patches, hypnotherapy, gum, acupuncture and everything else you could imagine. This time was patches plus the app and it worked then after a few weeks I dropped the patches and went to gum. I will always be a smoker in remission and on day 775 I still use a piece of gum now and again and when itâs really hard I open the app and itâs a re assurance on how far Iâve come. Probably I will use the app for life and maybe that will be a bit longer thanks in no small part to the app."

            "Review": "This app is great and has a ton of features, and most importantly a live chat room for support. I am giving it only 2* though for this reason here, a lot of the features are there and FREE but others are hidden unless you PAY. Quitting smoking is very important, and you would think if someone creates an app to quit then that should mean they care but based on this app seems nobody wants to help you for the better unless you pay, itâs always about the dollar. But back to the app, you can view all features and it is awesome but you really should not have to pay for something like this, chatroom is more updated if you pay, but you can view it and chat in it without paying so paying is not really needed. I also like the layout. This app has so many features that its unreal, I never knew smoking caused all the issues that have improved since I quit and the app keeps me updated on how many I have avoided, how much money I have saved, milestones reached and more life I have saved. If you did not have to pay and the app was fully free, I would definitely give 5*."

            "Review": "Itâs just not worth it. Thankfully, itâs cheap, so Iâm not to worried about it, but wanted to warn others. My biggest complaint is that people are depending on accurate health information, yet itâs highly inaccurate. After paying for the app you get provided with misinformation; such as, in about 5 years your risk of getting lung cancer will decrease to that of a non-smoker. Right under that lie, is a statement declaring they receive their information from W.H.O. Well, realizing itâs going to take much longer than 5 years to decrease my risk of lung cancer to such an extent, if at all, I went to the W.H.O. website to verify this information. There you learn, it takes 10 years to decrease your risk of lung cancer just by HALF. Also, it takes between 2-12 weeks to increase lung function and circulation, NOT 2 days as the app claims. There are others, but Iâm over texting this review now."
