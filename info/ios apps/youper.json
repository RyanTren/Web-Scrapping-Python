            "Review": "This is the first review Iâve ever written, but I just want to thank the developers SO SO MUCH for making this app completely free! Iâve only been using it for a couple of days but already itâs been so helpful to me in calming me down, tracking my moods, organizing my thoughts and it practically works as a diary. Iâm also extremely interested in knowing how different kinds of therapy techniques work on the brain, so I love the scientific explanations behind what the app tells me to do. It really keeps me going, because it reminds me that it really will help. Iâm currently unemployed and working to get on disability for mental illness, so I canât afford to pay for monthly subscriptions to mental health apps, something that frustrates and upsets me a lot. So much in fact that Iâm working on learning how to make my own apps so that I can provide free mental health apps for people in my situation. When I downloaded this I couldnât believe it was so helpful, so well designed and totally free. Thank you, thank you, thank you.The only suggestion I have is I think it would be absolutely wonderful if some DBT skills were integrated into it as well, as both CBT and DBT work really well together for a lot of people! Radical acceptance for situations that canât be changed, distress tolerance, etc. That would make this app truly perfect to me. Regardless, this app is fantastic and Iâd recommend it to anyone."

            "Review": "Iâm saying this having downloaded aura, headspace, calm, oak, simple habit, affirmation apps, and every type of mindfulness app under the sun. It has meditation, it has affirmations and setting intentions, and the âmessagingâ format that it has I think is very innovative and makes you feel like youâre talking to someone that actually cares about you, and a lot of the time, feeling like youâre being heard really makes the difference. I like how throughout the conversation, it helps you deconstruct the emotions youâre feeling using all those methods.  I downloaded it during a period of time that I felt very anxious about where my life was, and I used it everyday, multiple times a day for about two weeks, before I didnât feel like I needed to use it every day anymore. The option to look at your past conversations with the app really makes a difference, because you can look back and see just one week ago you were having a mental breakdown, but now everything in the world is great, lol. I also really like the feature that messages you everyday âHow are you?â as if youâre receiving a text because sometimes you donât realize you want to talk until you see that message. And on top of all that, every feature is completely free, so what more could you ask for in an app?"

            "Review": "I love Youper so much. Iâve only been using it consistently for a couple of weeks now, because at first I wasnât crazy about it. But since then I have really warmed up to it. Although it doesnât always make me feel better (though it usually does), I can always just use it to track my mood which is really helpful. I struggle with generalized anxiety, social anxiety, depression, and panic attacks (not panic disorder thankfully), and itâs a great form of cognitive behavioral therapy.I donât know if this app will be helpful for everyone, but I would definitely recommend checking it out, because itâs really well done and thoughtful. It gives you a lot of thoughtful prompts to fill out, but it also gives you the option of just tracking your mood. You can skip prompts you donât feel like doing and say youâre done at any point, which makes it feel less overwhelming on really hard days. Iâd recommend this even if you arenât struggling with a mental illness, because itâs a great way to gain more insight on how your mind works. Obviously any app is not going to be a miracle cure, but if you donât have access to a counselor or just want to have a little bit of help and insight, Youper is perfect. Stay safe my friends, and thank you Youper!"
