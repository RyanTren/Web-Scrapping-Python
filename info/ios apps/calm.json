            "Review": "Felix has a stunning, soothing, and low pitched voice. He should be added because a lot of people love his voice. And it could amplify the app's popularity among stays. It's a good idea. But it's not necessary. If your app is a voice-over, then you should use the same pitch as the voice, or even a lower one. The same goes for the text. A Felix has a stunning, soothing, and low pitched voice. He should be added because a lot of people love his voice. And it could amplify the app's popularity. Felix gets a load of support. If Felix's voice can help a 10 year old with autism calm down, it can help your users too. So it's good to have him. You can even add a Felix to your text messages if it helps your customers. This is an excellent idea and one that I've seen in a few places. I like this idea, because Felix has a stunning, soothing, and low pitched voice. He should be added because a lot of people love his voice. And it could amplify the app's popularity. Felix gets a load of support. If Felix's voice can help a 10 year old with autism calm down, it can help your users too. We have a ton of users that love Felix. His voice is amazing. That's why we'll be adding him to the list. Maybe you want to add Felix because he has this video series that is intended for people who canât sleep."

            "Review": "I love the Calm app!  I stumbled upon a television commercial about it a few years ago and decided to give it a try.  I have had trouble falling asleep for years, and was honestly skeptical that an app would put me to sleep. Boy was I wrong!  I love the different options - sleep stories, music, meditation - each one is interesting, and while I canât say Iâve managed to get to end of a storyâ¦well thatâs the point.  Iâm out within five minutes.  Iâve read some reviews about the expense - hereâs the thing - what is your sleep and a relaxed mindset worth to you?  Divide that annual cost by 365 and youâre paying a pittance for your health.  Check back around the holidays - the makers of Calm run specials sometimes that make it even more worthwhile.  I had just renewed my annual fee two summers ago, when an end of year special came around.  It was a lifetime subscription that was going to save hundreds of dollars over the years. I knew I wouldnât get the remainder of my annual fee (8 months left) refunded if I jumped on the lifetime subscription, but it was still worth the jump.  This is a must have app. *App makers - please put the sleep check-in back!  With the latest update it is gone, and it was something that really helped understanding factors that affect sleep."
