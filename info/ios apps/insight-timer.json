            "Review": "Our family has loved Insight Timer for years now. Nearly every update has been an improvement on an already great app. We use it when putting our little ones to bed at night (and weâre too exhausted to tell them a story or sing to them ourselves). My 8-yo particularly loves Cori Cochiolo, especially her Heidi, Cherry, and Vaya series. Our kids often turn it on when they go to sleepovers, especially if theyâre having trouble falling asleep. Their friends usually start using it, too. Personally, Iâve used it for myriad thingsâ¦. Itâs a fantastic support / encouragement for staying consistent with my meditation practice. It helps me fall asleep, whether that be music, stories, or guided meditations. It helps me go back to sleep. Sometimes I've participated in their courses and challenges (Iâd like to do more of them). Iâve reconnected with some of my favorite Kripalu teachers from years past, who are active on this site. Iâve even found super helpful sessions that help me wake up in the mornings with a positive mindset (even before coffee!!). I could not recommend this app more highly. The options are endless, and you can financially support the content creators as/when youâre ableâ¦so you can use it regardless of your financial state. I view it as having a personal meditation âtrainerâ come to my home a few times a day, for support and guidance. For me, thatâs priceless."

            "Review": "I use to love this app and for years it was my favorite app, but it no longer is able to manage itâs basic functionality.  The timer function constantly pauses during calls and wonât restart no matter what, or just completely shuts down during sessions.  The Insight support usually has the same tired response, re-download it etc. etc, but nothing is working.  That and the app would also loose my day count for meditation whenever I flew out of my time zone.The app was sold several years ago and their became a rapid shift towards competing with other mindfulness apps like Headspace and Calm.  It is clear that the new developers are much more interested in creating a new age social network and promoting different healers, many of which seem unvetted.  All of this functionality seems fine, but to let go of the basic timer function is disappointing and doesnât seem like much of a technological challenge.Bottom line this should be called INSIGHT SOCIAL NETWORK or CHEAP GURU, but when TIMER is in your name and you canât even keep time, whatâs the point.  They also donât really give a crap about customer complaints because this is now years that I have been dealing with this issue.  In the end, I lost my Zen due to my meditation timer app which is a dark joke in itself.  Goodbye insight!"
