            "Review": "This app is the best free mental health tool Iâve ever come across. The fact that itâs free and you have access to almost every feature without holding back the most important things that will truly help a person truly shows that those who made this care about others genuinely. Unlike meditation and other self-help apps that charge exorbitant amounts of money they are able to positively effect those who are searching for, and need, the help they deserve but canât afford it. I am truly grateful I live in a world where I know developers like this exist and it gives me hope that there are more out there that still aim to use technology to reach out and help others, not just make a profit. As soon as I can afford it I want to make a point to buy a membership because I believe in their cause and I hope they become the number one app for self-help across all application stores."

            "Review": "I love this app very much. I really like all the tools it has to improve mood. The primary reason why I am giving this four stars instead of five stars Hass to do with the accessibility with voiceover. Voiceover is an accessibility service that changes how the device works to help blind and visually impaired people like me use the touchscreen. In order for voiceover to work well, the app and the interface Hass to be programmed right. Don't get me wrong, because I do think this is one of the most accessible apps for mood out there, but it is lacking a couple of things with voiceover accessibility. For example, when I try to customize the days for a reminder, voiceover does not give me any indication of which days are checked off. For the days that are checked off for the reminders, why not have voiceover say something like M selected or M checked? That would give blind and visually impaired users an indication that Monday is checked off. Otherwise, everything else about this app is great. If it wasn't for the voiceover accessibility problem, then I would give this five stars."

            "Review": "I have struggled with sleep since I was a child, but have never thought to journal it until recently. This app has been great for that, it helps me track how many nights of poor sleep versus how many nights of decent sleep I am actually getting. I include factors in my entry that could be impacting my sleep, such as caffeine consumed during the day, exercise, stressors of the previous day, alcohol consumed the previous day, etc. It has been really helpful to be able to look back and see what factors help and what factors hinder sleep. I also use the mood tracking function so I can observe how mood and sleep correlate with each other. I decided to just stick with those two things for simplicity, but I like how many different things there are that you can track with the app."
