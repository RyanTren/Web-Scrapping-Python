            "Review": "For years now, Iâve been struggling with a plethora of mental health issues on top of adhd, and itâs made it extremely difficult for me to take care of myself even with professional help. Iâve learned to take care of my emotions, but the motivation to do things has never been there for me especially with my adhd. Doing things like going and getting a cup of water, washing my face, getting clothes off the floor or bringing bowls and plates down from my room has always been something thatâs felt genuinely impossible. On top of all of that even, Iâve never had any motivation to stretch or work out. Iâve downloaded so many of these apps and theyâve all just been gimmicky and overpriced, and Iâve found they only made me feel worse because the reminders felt pointless and made me feel like I didnât care about myself. With Finch, i not only feel reinforced that I care about myself, I also feel cared for by my finch, and I feel that by taking care of myself, im also taking care of him. In the past few days, Iâve done so much more with this app then I ever thought. Im really happy that I finally have some motivational help that actually works. I absolutely love finch and I actually couldnât recommend it more. Also, Iâd like to mention that I havenât reviewed an app for like four years now because thereâs never been an app that I cared for like this. Iâm really happy to use this app and I want you to try it if youâre reading this."

            "Review": "I have ADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. This disorder makes it really hard to use apps like these or even just stay on these apps. Iâve tried dozens of apps like these to try and make something work for me, but nothing ever worked. But when I opened Finch, it was just amazing from the start! It had a way of gamifying the things that I had to do and made it so much easier to complete them. I also loved taking care of my very own birb and customizing itâs clothes and furniture. I always looked forward to opening this app every day and have never strayed away from it since Iâve downloaded it. I know many people do not have ADHD but even for people who donât, this app is incredible! They have breathing exercises and reflections to help you grow while using the app. They even have a first aid kit for your mental health if your ever in a panic or anxiety related situation. Although many people might not want to download this app because some features are deducted because your not a plus member, you donât need to worry as everything you need will not be locked, and youâll have a greater variety as a plus member! At first, I was struggling with completing tasks for my mental health and even habit trackers couldnât help me. But downloading Finch has made it just as much easier for me to flow through these tasks with ease. So, if you are reading this, I really recommend you to download this app. Your birb is waiting for you! ð"
