            "Review": "I am giving a explanation because I think Iâm not the only one that avoids mental health apps and want to reassure them that this app is nothing like any of the other apps. Also as a genuine thank you to the developer ðNothing is worse than thinking something can help you just to find out it is filled with âlive love laughâ, âyouâre specialâ, âomg mercury in retrogradeâ. Thatâs all nice but it is shallow and unhelpful. Some apps with breathing exercises and cutesy quotes really make me feel invalidated and that feeling better is just as easy as namaste. That if you just say the word âpositiveâ over and over nothing bad will ever happen. So when I found this app I was sooooo happy. I share it with anyone overwhelmed by their mental state and especially when they had little resources available.I have severe anxiety attacks from PTSD and this app has saved my life. It is clear the developer is a professional and is focused on helping people get grounded and understand their emotions on a deeper level. Sometimes there is just no level of advice that takes the intensity of an emotion away. Sometimes you are just going to feel but this helped me through that in one piece and educated me on how to identify what I need."

            "Review": "Love love love it. I've suffered from depression and anxiety for years. Many mental health apps have come and gone but I've kept this one consistently (longer than almost any other) since it offers such quick, clear help. I use it mostly for anxiety for quick help, for my depression for more general help. When you're really freaking out (or just a bit!) this is the easiest one I've found to get quick help where I don't have to think too much about how to use the app itself in order to let it help me. Open the app, top choice is \"Help Right Now\" - so simple! Click it and the choice is equally clear \"Stop!\" Click that and it walks you through a short series of actions to calm you down and bring you back to reality. So many of the others are too wordy or too many bells and whistles; you canât find your way around or if I do find my way usually itâs difficult to find the helpful parts again, esp. if Iâm really in crisis. When I'm not in a crisis, the rest of the app is equally helpful and gives lots of clear good ideas of techniques for overall feeling better. Keep up the good work you guys and thank you so so so much for all many times of this app's support and calming me down and helping me back to reality."

It is very user friendly and even has a wonderful orientation in the beginning that helps you get started. I think my favorite feature is the chat forum. I really like that you can post what youâre feeling, ask for advice, etc. and people can reply to you. And everyone is always so nice! Itâs honestly a very positive app! If I could suggest anything to be added, it would be a private chat feature or something along those lines. The only reason I say that is because you will definitely find people you relate to and want to keep talking to, but the only way to do that is by replying to their post which is out in the open for everyone to see. Other than that this app is phenomenal! I highly recommend it to everyone!"
