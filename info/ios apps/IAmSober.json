            "Review": "This is a pretty cool app actually. Itâs awesome because you can track multiple addictions. Like for me Iâm in recovery for alcohol and drugs but I also quit smoking like a month into my recovery so now I can also track that. It lets you put in how much you think you spent a day on your addiction in both money and hours and itâs pretty cool to see how much Iâve saved money wise. I had no idea how much I was spending a day on drugs and cigarettes. It blows my mind! It also sends you positive quotes and motivational quotes. You can buy extra packs of motivation for like a dollar and the one I got gives me exercises to try every once in a while. But I think the coolest part about it is it lets you review your day at the end of the day and you get to say whether or not you made your pledge how the day went from impossible to easy and then you put what activities youâve done and then it gives you like a little text journal and you can journal a little bit about your day. Yesterday was a really hard day for me and after I submitted it it has a pop up that said âitâs tough. Weâre rooting for you!â And I thought that was pretty cool. Little things like that make me happy. It also calculates milestones and shows you how many other people are teaching that milestone with you. I mean this app has so many awesome things about it! Just download the app and try it out and youâll see just how awesome it is!! (:"

            "Review": "I have been addicted to heroin for about 8 years, I just turned 25 a few days ago. I gave birth to my beautiful baby girl in January and she changed my life and motivated me to get clean. This app along with my clinic, my counselor, and my family all help me to stay clean. My family has a group text so every morning they look forward to me sharing my daily motivation because the affirmations start their days off with a positive mindset too!! I love how this app tracks your sobriety to the very second, and tracks how much money youâve saved and how many hours youâve saved since getting clean. The developers are constantly tweaking the app to make it better and add new motivation packs pretty regularly, I own almost every pack so every month once I finish one pack I start a new one. I realllllllllly LOVE how the app celebrates all the milestones, because itâs exciting to celebrate every month sober, especially the big milestones like 100 days, 6 months, 1 year, etc. I go to a methadone clinic and I always recommend the I Am Sober app to my counselor and to anyone there who is still struggling and especially to people who are newly sober because itâs helped me so much. This app has become a really important part of my day, and I plan to keep utilizing it for as long as possible for my sobriety!!"

            "Review": "The overall app is amazing. I love the setup, the prices, and itâs just a great appâ¦ but the community is toxic. Day 2 and Iâve seen over 8 comments talking and making fun of p0rnographic addictions/harassment. I have since blocked every comment I see like this, but they keep popping up. There are women who show off intimates, inappropriate clothing/scenes, and just overall toxicity and disrespect. Iâm 15 years old and I struggle with with sort of thing. Seeing people make fun of it like itâs a joke to be tossed around hurtsâ¦ I love the app. There are also comments encouraging people to self harm, and giving ways to hide it from family and also ways to hurt yourself MORE. I canât stand to go on the community page anymore because of the people. Some people take it seriously, and I donât want to be the person that gets offended by everything. But commenting and making fun of things people are STRUGGLING with on an app that is supposed to HELP with that, is not okay. The guidelines say strictly not to do this, and yet itâs completely uncensored and unsupervised (to my knowledge). Iâm leaving the community page to avoid the drama going on there. But if the people who made this app are reading this, please be aware of this and create stricter chats. I love this app too much to get rid of it, and it motivates me and makes me feel cared for. The ONLY thing bothering me is the community. If you read this far, just be aware."
