            "Review": "This app was a great help to me as part of my recovery from severe insomniaSecondary to a mercury poisoning. I would put this app on when I could not return to sleep and it would help me move into a deep rest ... as I healed it would return me to sleep... And eventually  I was sleeping long 6-8 hour blocks agawe'rein. Learning to be fully present to myself and to move through overwhelming emotions like anxiety, grief or depression... Letting the wave pass... Letting go... Was essential to the healing of my nervous system and restoration of neuro-transmitters.. This app was a great tool to help me learn that skill as was meditation on the Truth of God's  constant Loving Presence in Scripture."

            "Review": "This was my introduction to meditation. I learned basic skills. I have suffered with depression and have been medicated most of my life. I am able to remain happy and centered without drugs now. (I realize some people still need that additional help and there is no shame in that) I am grateful for the skills I started to learn from this and other meditations from Mary. It has been a wonderful thing. I have broadened my library of meditations but I often return to this one. It is simple and effective at helping me get out of my thoughts and Simply Be me."

            "Review": "I am amazed and so happy with this guided Meditation for Relaxation. I listen to it while Im trying to go to sleep. Before I started listening to this I would lay awake for at least 45 minutes trying to go to sleep.... Many nights over the past decade. The first night I used this app I was asleep in less than 10 minutes. No sleep aid needed nor for the past 7 days.  THANK YOU. The voice volume and the music volume are separately adjustable. The guided voice is very pleasant with no high tones and no disruptions. I will recommend this app to all."
