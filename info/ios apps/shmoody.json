            "Review": "i got this during a very low point, I was procrastinating and unable to do anything because my mind was so overcrowded with tasks I knew I needed to complete. I know it sounds clichÃ© but I really feel like this app slows down my day. I can get more done taking it little by little (with the organizational help of shmoody) and feel more comfortable knowing i have a place to write what im feeling privately. the little âdescribe how youre feelingâ feature is literally like the notes app with a few more steps. you can add little tags and theres so many descriptive emojis, its super useful but also satisfying to look at. the schedule thingy makes me feel so achieved when i complete all the tasks or most of them and get points. another thing i like is that i can use it to document my mood swings because it shows you the exact time you made each entry. i feel like ive come to a better understanding of the fact that sometimes its not that the world is falling apart and im rotting its just 3am and im sleep deprived. for some reason i didnt think about that pattern before lol. i love this app i never forget to write in it at least once a day because i genuinely enjoy using it. i think it rlly is helpful to ppl w adhd."

            "Review": "This app has so much potential to be an amazing app, but has so many bugs and not fully functional features that itâs just not worth the very high price they charge. I love idea of this app so much and would gladly pay the yearly subscription IF it actually worked well. But itâs like the app is stuck in some kind of beta testing version â there are feature requests/bug reports listed inside the app by other members, with absolutely no response from the developer. Features and bug fixes will be marked as âin progressâ for months on end, with no fix or update actually pushed out. Iâve only been using this app for a couple of days and am still in my trial period, but I am extremely disappointed in how poorly this app functions. The features it offers are so innovative and are like no other app Iâve seen, but I just wish the developer would fix the glitchy issues and make the features function better so that the app was actually usable. For example, when you create a routine and save your plan, youâre not able to edit the plan. It would be nice to add, delete, and drag-and-drop items in your saved plan, but you canât. You have to delete the whole plan and start from scratch. Lots of other features donât work, or glitch, or are cumbersome to use. It makes me really sad, as I really wanted this app to work out. I likely wonât be subscribing, given all the issues, which is such a shame because the app has such great potential."

            "Review": "Actually a helpful app. The text helper is genius. It has a lot of great features to help you tack not only goals but things that make you happy(itâs called joy time on the app). It has a whole playlist of relaxing music and sounds that automatically plays while using the app(you can keep it on even when not on the app but can also turn it off as well). Like I said w the text helper, thereâs basically a feature that allows you to plug in the person youâre messaging to, what you want to text them about, and the tone you want the message to be in. Really helpful when you are at a loss for words but still want to text someone back. It also has a chat guru thing where it has an ai advice giver that you can talk to for advice. Thereâs also a community section where people will post mental health related questions and stuff thatâs nice because itâs honest and anonymous. From what Iâve seen, no one uses the community feature to post weird or disturbing stuff. Itâs just a positive safe place to voice stuff. Rlly good app."
