            "Review": "Iâve always spent a lot of time and energy worrying about things that may or may not actually happen, and if they do, may or may not end up as bad as I feared. Using this app has allowed me to verbalize my fears, categorize them, and reflect back on them. In doing so, Iâm able to identify unnecessary worry more quickly when something similar occurs. I like to use the notes section of each event to spill all my thoughts, set a reminder to revisit the event, and (as much as possible) just forget about it until then. Because I verbalized all my thoughts and worries, Iâm able to obsess over them less on a daily basis. And when I revisit it, itâs almost always not as bad as I had thought it would be.Customer service is also fantastic. They are quick to respond to questions and very receptive to suggestions."

            "Review": "This is a fantastic app that helps me get my anxieties out and find some relief. I worry about the most random things and can never seem to let them go until the outcome has arrived. This adds a lot whole lot of additional stress in my life I donât need. With this app, Iâm able to write down my worry, set a reminder, and walk away from worrying about it. After I write it down, I feel so much better and 80% of the time I can drop whatever it is Iâm worrying about, knowing the reminder will alert me to record the outcome. I feel that the more I use it, the more I will be able to rid my mind of my worry once written down and bring that 80% to 100%. I love seeing the percentages of the outcomes and realizing that what worries me is usually never as bad as I had thought."

But then they changed it to this new interface and now I donât even use it anymore. It has way too many other things like meditation and breathing that I can get with other apps. They tried to put too much into this app when it wasnât necessary. I just needed something to track my worries. Developers if you read this, please consider switching it back to the old interface. Thank you!"
