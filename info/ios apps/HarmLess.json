            "Review": "Hello! So, let me start off with great notes. This has been my go to app for whenever I feel that I canât really keep up with my thoughts & urges. I love it. I would recommend this app; However.. the advertisements for âpremiumâ isnât cool. Itâs the very first thing you see the minute you open this app, and I find that a bit.. insensitive, I guess? I donât mean to sound like Iâm offended by it, though, I donât see why we need to pay just to be able to have more outlets for help. I wouldnât mind it, of course, but this advertisement shows EVERY TIME you open the app. Maybe if it was more of a one-time pop up, then you could buy it somewhere in the app itself, Iâd like that a bit more. But this ad shows up each time and itâs really annoying. Itâs also very sad, especially for those that just want to cope freely without needing to pay for such support. Now, Iâm not saying that this app isnât good enough!!! I love it. Itâs helped a lot; given the fact that Iâm very young & canât exactly reach out comfortably, without parents knowing. But, all in all, I would recommend. Itâs just the advertisements that really get me. Anyways, thank you for reading. Iâm proud of you, donât give up, have a great day/night! <3"
