            "Review": "Iâve been using Bearable for about a month (after trying out some other trackers). I felt compelled to leave a review as I typically fall off the wagon with these kinds of things, but Iâm consistently using this app after a month. I I canât speak to what Bearable does or doesnât do in comparison with others, because I never made it past the initial steps with the other apps and got frustrated with too many options and the general inflexibility (made me feel like I had to figure out exactly what I wanted to track right then and there when life just isnât like that). Bearable has a ton of ways to customize that can seem overwhelming, but you can also initially hide those categories and track the most important stuff first and add in other factors and symptoms as time goes on.I really like that it integrates with apple health and I really love that the developer is very open to feedback and sharing about features that are in the works. Integration with Fitbit would be great, but for now syncing my Fitbit info to apple health with FitSync is working absolutely fine. Bearable automatically grabs the info.The trial period was SO helpful. Other apps have trial periods as well, but I cancelled them only days in after Iâd had enough. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop but itâs yet to happen with this. Highly recommended."

            "Review": "To start off with, this is the first app review that I have ever written - and I stopped using Bearable consistently probably a year ago, but occasionally it weighs on my heart to let others know my success story with Bearable. I had struggled with severe major depression, generalized anxiety, PTSD, and OCD (and still do, to a lesser extent) for close to a decade. I decided to invest in Bearable because anxiety had begun leaving me completely unable to function every single day â like literally spent a week in bed just incessantly panicking. Cue setting up Bearable, painstakingly inputting every detail I could think of. I found after several months of use that many of the things that I thought were ârightâ were actually leaving me in absolute wreckage, while my partner and his family were consistently bring my mood up SUBSTANTIALLY. Seeing the numbers laid out encouraged me to make the difficult decision of leaving what I now identify was a cult. It helped me cut ties with abusive situations that had trapped my family for generations. It helped me learn what joy was after years of hospital visits, SH episodes, panic attacks, and starvation. I am now living my best life and will look to Bearable again occasionally for answers to menial health concerns. This app changed my life and I would almost definitely not be here without it."

            "Review": "I take a whole laundry list of meds that change frequently, and I just found out I'm autistic, and I have been battling major depression, PTSD, and anxiety for years. I also have chronic migraines from a severe head injury. Because of my autism, it's been difficult to communicate how I'm doing to my therapists and psychiatrists and doctors, and often I was not believed about the severity of my symptoms, or accused of not taking my medication, or told that my sleep or energy is better than I think it is. Now I have EMPIRICAL DATA all gathered in one place that provides an accurate assessment of my moods, symptoms both mental and physical, everything all in one place. My only complaint is that I wish you could time stamp EVERYTHING, not just medication times and mood and energy but also factors and symptoms instead of being limited to 4 time ranges because I'd like to see if a short-term intervention works and right now I can only see that I listen to relaxing music when I get anxious, but not whether I feel less anxious after listening to relaxing music. But this is the best app out there right now."
