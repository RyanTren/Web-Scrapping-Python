            "Review": "I was seeking an app to help me stay on schedule. As an entrepreneur with ADHD it is often very challenging. From going to bed at a reasonable hour, each night, to waking up at a reasonable hour, to having balanced structured meals that are healthy, to have my spiritual time, exercise time, and just me time. I also needed to find time to do service, which helps me get out of myself by helping others. Iâve never had a structured schedule, my whole entire life and Iâm 55 years old when I started the section on evening routine and I was about to type in the fourth change that I wanted to make the app actually would not let me, I loved that it said we never want to take on more than we should. Iâve only been using for less than a week and I can tell you Iâm going to bed now. Two hours earlier. I am making it to the office earlier. I am doing better with the morning routine but I still have a long way to go. I actually stopped working. Looked at the app clicked it and that is something different. One of the best things this App has suggested to me was on my iPhone pro 14 max to take any interesting and fun apps off of the homepage. Itâs worked. It literally works I just keepspiritual thing on there, my daily calendar, reminders list or to do list. I have a long way to go with this app is reminded me is that there is absolutely no rush. I will appreciate life more by doing certain things less get the app and pay for it. Well worth it."

            "Review": "This is probably the best app you could EVER HAVE on your phone. I left a rating a while back but it really deserves a full review. Im a 20 year old college female who suffers from severe mental health issues and addiction, and have for most of my life. I was so depressed that getting up to shower felt like an 8 hour shift, so most of the time i let basic self care take a backseat. During my trip to rock bottom i stumbled across Fabulous. Its exactly what i wanted that other programs didnt have, it keeps you on track and its ENJOYABLE. and i can say its great for people with ocd, adhd, or autism. Now, after only 3 months, i drink water, eat 3 meals, exercise daily, practice mindfulness, and take care of my hygiene better than ever before! Im even about to QUIT VAPING after 4 years, which is something i never thought was possible. I can actually relax at the end of the day because i know i have done everything i need to do, and Fabulous will remind you of that. My mental and physical health have improved so much in so little time, I will probably never stop using this app.Unfortunately, the poor reviews here arent (completely) asinine. They do have severe billing issues that they have yet to fix. Please, be VERY CAREFUL if you decide to accept a free trial or purchase a subscription. I have fallen victim to the double charging, double subscriptions, etc. (pro tip, contact apple, not fabulous)"
