            "Review": "I was blown away by how profoundly this super simple app changed my thinking. I went to 3 therapists and could have spent the years (maybe the rest of my life) talking about cognitive behavioral therapy techniques without being able to readily implement them. Obviously there are always multiple arenas for combatting mental health issues, but the change these exercises made in my brain was so fast, so effective, so easy. I used to think that the âbe aware of your thoughts and challeng themâ approach sounded like toxic positivity, or just like a tiresome, endless exercise of smacking away an endless barrage of negative ideasâlike one of those tennis ball machines shooting balls at you faster than you can smack them away. But this app took away the need to try to combat those obsessive thoughts in my own, or in real situations. It gives you the opportunity to just sink in positive thoughts with such repetition, and with the added effectiveness of seeing them and swiping them awayâ¦it just drills it in so much more solidly than if you just try to drum the thoughts up on your own. For me, this was a GAME CHANGER. Like the difference between trying to get in shape without a gym or equipment or personal trainer vs with having that."

I know itâs been so nice to have on my phone for times when I was especially down or struggling and needed to know that other people got what you were going through. Ted and Anil have been so so helpful and kind! Theyâve bent over backwards to accommodate me and to extend discounts where I needed them. Ted did my assessment and was extremely thorough, empathetic and took as much time as I needed. He created a judgment free zone for me to tell everything that I was going through without having to feel afraid and gave me the diagnosis that I needed. Anil also was willing to give me a call and let me know any information I might need. Overall, Iâm extremely grateful and impressed by this organization and by the people who work for it. Itâs very professional and still personable which is ESSENTIAL for mental health patients! Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou! I wouldnât be where I am today with out the help of NOCD."

            "Review": "When I first started therapy with NOCD, the groups were led by a licensed therapist named Jenna. She was very professional and seemed dedicated to her work. At that time most of the groups were also facilitated by licensed therapists. But we have recently noticed a shift in how the therapy groups are organized. Most of the groups are led by the same advocates, sometimes in 1 day there are back-to-back groups by the same host, repeatedly. The company gives the impression of offering a variety of OCD-themed groups, but in reality, 70% of the groups are managed similarly, lacking actual variety. Unlike some groups run by licensed therapists that have a specific viewpoint and educational component, many groups turn into open-ended forums until the final minute of the hour, where the same, often narcissistic attendees repeatedly dominate discussions. Groups are frequently canceled last minute when moderators fail to show up regularly, and weâre lucky if weâre notified in advance. While emergencies can occur, this level of inconsistency is offensive. These groups are crucial for our recovery journal while in therapy that we pay NOCD very much for, and they should not be seen as just an additional benefit."
