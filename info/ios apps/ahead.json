            "Review": "I love having this to help me work through my emotions. As an ADHD mom of two girls, who also have ADHD, and wife to a husband who has ADHD, we have a lot of big feelings in our household. My husband and I also did not grow up in the most appropriate/safe households, so we are trying to beat a lot of learned behaviors and become different parents for our daughters. I especially grew up in a household full of anger, anxiety, insecurity and other unhealthy feelings. Knowing that I am a role model for our daughters, as it pertains to being a lady, itâs important that I show them how to be strong and stand up for themselves (and challenge themselves as well). I have my own counselor to help me but I see her every two weeks. Itâs helpful to have something available everyday whenever I need it for only a few minutes. Usually itâs the reminders that make me dive into my own mind that I need. I was a little skeptical at first because Iâve tried all those apps or programs out there. But this one makes me think more deeply and thatâs what I need."

            "Review": "The app seems REALLY cool , but itâs a huge reading-focused app with a lack of accessibilityâprimarily in the text format, which makes it more difficult and frustrating for me. As someone who took the ACT with accommodations for the blind and dyslexic, which included having a person read the test to me, I find the app's lack of an audible feature to be a significant barrier. I canât use the tools on my iPhone that I usually rely on to have the text read or \"spoken\" out loud. This limitation requires me to push myself even more to use the app, which is something I really want to do. Overall, I feel that, without an audible feature, it's not the most realistic use of my time. However, if that changes, I would definitely like to take part in this app!!! Additionally, I suggest adding a definition feature so that every user can have the freedom to not have to feel like an idiot constantly looking it up on Google. It's worth noting that apps like Speechify demonstrate how adding accommodations can benefit a wide range of people, and platforms like Quizlet already offer an audible feature, making learning more accessible to all. And perhaps a question tool, if one of ur stamens is confusing and in need of further explanation."

            "Review": "Some of the techniques have been really helpful, but the modules consist of a LOT of fill in the blank type of questions, and picking whether a particular reaction is a sign of anger or not. It feels strange to have there be only ONE correct explanation of certain emotions, and it is particularly perplexing why I have to go under the stress of possibly picking the wrong answer when Iâm just trying to work on myself. Why are users treated like grade school students at the mercy of some arbitrary determination of whether an action is motivated by anger or not, just so they can be subject to unnecessary judgment? For example, I thought âtrying to make eye contactâ wasnât a sign because I would make eye contact with people out of respect or to show that Iâm listening to them, but the app told me that it could be a sign of anger from âfeeling left out.â It might make sense with 20/20 hindsight but I often struggle to wrap my head around these questions/answers. Alternatively, supposing that the app has all the correct answers, at least show me a good number examples of signs of anger before throwing me in the middle of multiple choice questions please."
