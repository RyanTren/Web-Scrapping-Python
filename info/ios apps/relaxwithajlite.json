            "Review": "This developer canât be trusted.  Iâm going through a very stressful time and my phone with Relax+ was stolen too.  Now with a new phone, I canât install Relax+ (where I spent over $50 on in-app purchases). Itâs missing?  Now thereâs a gauntlet of apps instead, all paid, each one to play an individual recording that I already purchased in Relax+.  So I have to make 10 new app purchases just to replace the one app that I already bought?  Is it fair that a developer has my money but I canât redownload what I paid for? This whole ordeal has added to my stressed situation as I canât afford to re-buy all of these things for a SECOND time.  Worst experience ever.  Makes me weary of buying anything on an App Store where a developer can just remove your app and release a new one that is identical so you have to buy again. JUST LEAVE THE OLD ONE UP TOO!  Arghhhh."
