            "Review": "I want to start off by saying I think RAINN is very helpful. Iâve gotten a lot of information on how to process and recover from what Iâve gone through, and itâs helped me a lot. However, I tried to chat with someone via text because I felt more comfortable that way and I was put on hold. I understand that may happen but I was 15th in line, and when I got to 9th, they pushed me back up to 10th. I then tried to call the hotline and was met with someone who seemed like they were half paying attention and sounded like they were talking to me across the room. I hung up after a minute because I felt like they didnât care and I kept having to repeat myself. I appreciate what RAINN does. Theyâre one of the only good resources Iâve found for this type of thing. But in terms of contact with actual people, itâs not great. Being put on hold and then getting in touch with someone who doesnât care feels so crappy and makes me think twice before reaching out to someone again."

I have tried to delete and redownload the app all day, and itâs still not working and Iâm not sure where to report it so Iâm hoping I can get help from here. Other than that the app is great, but I primarily wanted it for the HelpRoom."

            "Review": "The people who created the name forced their way into creating an acronym that would match up with another entirely different RAIN. That way, they can hide which rain they are talking  about. Make it rain is most commonly used to describe the down pour of money from the stock market and itâs also used in basketball. I think the name of the place is vulgar and distasteful. It is basically repeating the same word over and over and over just to make it form the word rain. And if a business is going  to do something like that then Iâm hesitant to trust them. Iâve called in before and because Iâm a male, and I spoke to a women, I didnât get any sort of help. She was as idiotic and rude and the opposite of what a person should be like. So Iâll try this app and see if I can get anywhere."
