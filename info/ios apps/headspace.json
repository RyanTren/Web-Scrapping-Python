            "Review": "The app that I chose to review is called Headspace, and it is a meditation app that helps manage stress by showing mindfulness excercises, and offers information on how to manage other things such as anxiety or worry. This app did an amazing job at helping me be more mindful throughout the day. In the \"Headspace library\", there were tabs for certain scenarios like \"navigating injustice, reframe stress and relax, mindful money, anger/sadness/growth, mindful eating, and guide to sleep,\". Each tab had different podcasts and meditation methods that corresponded to that subject. I enjoyed using this app because as a person who worries often, this tool allowed me to take time out of my day to clear my head and do something that betters my mental health. This app is relevant to abnormal psychology because it includes ways to manage anxiety and worry. Although it is not an app that diagnoses or properly treats symptoms of anxiety, it does relieve some worry by the various methods used in the app; it helps people who may want to feel better, but may not be ready to see a professional, don't have access to proper mental healthcare, or wants to try something quick that is available by simply pulling out their phone. Overall, this app was a game-changer for me as freshman in college, and it is a great way to meditate and reflect, all while teaching me how to manage my constant worry I feel throughout my day."

            "Review": "The best mindfulness app. User friendly, the mediation teachers come from all different walks of life & you can tell that they truly LOVE what they do, so passionate helping others and one person at a time are slowly changing the world for the better. They even have things for families & kids. Iâve grown into a better person in all aspects of my life and was able to accomplish things that the âoldâ me wouldâve never imagined. Iâve learned so much over these 2 years about myself and the world around me. Andy and Eve were the first ones I started listening to & then they got Kessonga and Dora who I felt even closer to (through culture, headspace and their added vulnerability to speak about their lives on a level I could relate with). I truly believe in investing in my mental health & have tried other guided meditation apps, but never truly connected with them & it never impacted my life like Headspace. I decided to joined Headspace in 2020 & started with the monthly payments. March 2022 I upgraded to the yearly membership. 14,601 minutes later, I can honestly say itâs the BEST thing Iâve ever given myself. TLDR: If youâre thinking about trying headspace, give the 30 day free trial a run and with consistent practice, youâll want to  invest your money in your mental healthy too! Podcast: Radio Headspace is also a part of my morning routine & I listen to it every morning on my commute."
