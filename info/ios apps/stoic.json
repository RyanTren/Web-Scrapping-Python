            "Review": "There was a period in my life where I felt stuck. Where no matter which direction I took, I was overcome with feelings of regret and skepticism, only to end up back at square one and repeat the cycle, over and over and over again. This period lasted for almost two years, and in that time, I was in the darkest place in my life. I was tired, but I didn't sleep. I was full, but I didn't fast. I was lonely, but I didn't seek. I was laughing, but I didn't smile. It truly felt like I was reaching the end of my rope and grasping to find nothing was there to begin with. To find that my life had amounted to nothing.This review isn't here to tell you the cliche \"This app changed my life!\", but once I started using Stoic, it did get me THINKING about my life. I realized I was so focused on trying to control aspects outside of my control and achieving the dreams that weren't even my own, I had lost sight of who should've been living my life: me. It sounds obvious at first, right? You are the only one that has the power to live your life, right? Yet, there are people who are obssesed with trying to fill a hole that was dug by others. It shouldn't have to be this way. It doesn't have to be this way. You are in control of your life, cause no one else is you. Thank you Stoic, for not only turning on the lights, but for teaching me how to keep them on."

            "Review": "This app just keeps getting better and better. While using stoicism as a framework, this app has really been a way for me to practice personal reflection and awareness, cultivating better emotional wellness. Easily accessible techniques for gratitude, journaling, meditation, and breathing exercises without the pressure of any one thing being a requirement. The app guides you to those tools through a pleasant sequence without any pressure to use specific techniques. Itâs so gentle. If you want to journal, then journal. If you want to meditate, then do that. And if you donât, thatâs ok too. Itâs totally up to you. I find tremendous value in the simple act of making these sequences a part of my daily morning and evening routine; from simply opening the app and assessing how I feel to what my priority for the day is to how productive I felt. The app now even guides personal reflection towards specific categories. If in the morning I say Iâm going to focus on reading, in the evening the app will then guide me to reflect on recalling what I read that day. So simple, but so helpful. Excellent user experience, an essential part of my every day routine now."

            "Review": "I have always wanted to journal my entire life. Looking at a blank piece of paper always inspired me to write down my own âlife experiences.â But alas I never did such thing, until last year I downloaded Stoic. At first I didnât write anything and nearly deleted this app, but then I did start writing, and I havenât stopped. 230 app check-ins, 118 journal entries, and just under 7000 words. I love this app, the creators behind it actually care and give an effort to inspire you. I check in everyday, sometimes just to view my life progress. I had times I was up and down, others I was inspired, and some I was just filled with hate and a burning ego. But now I recognize that; I recognize how I was, how I am, and how I should be. All because of this app. The developers should be proud of this creation, for it has changed my life immensely.Now my only con: I am concerned I will lose my progress, all it would take would be one accident with my ever aging phone, and thatâs it. All gone. I canât afford to pay the price of subscription every month, but I wish there was a one time payment option that would allow you to save your progress. Having that would be a godsend, and would rightfully earn this app a full 5 stars.Thank you for reading."
