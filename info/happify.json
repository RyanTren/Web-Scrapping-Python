            "Review": "I had Happify on my phone for a couple of years before I used it. I got it for free when Starbucks gave away apps and music. I started a minimalism lifestyle transition earlier this year and by summer decided to reduce the number of apps on my phone. I decided to open up Happify and see what it was about before I deleted it. I did the first track recommend and it was awesome. I was going through my annual feeling stuck and hopeless season. I felt I needed to do something drastic this time around. I was tired of the loop that was my life. I had to break free. No drastic actions needed. This app gradually transformed my mind state. I am happier now for real. I donât have to force myself to be happy. I have less anxiety about money, my negative mind-state is now struggling for survival instead of being dominant. I feel freer. I have a refreshing perspective on life-a paradigm shift.  When the student is ready the Teacher will appear. This app was in my life, patiently waiting for me to see it. Thank you Starbucks. Thank you Happify. Thank you Universe for putting tools in place in my life. The Universe puts things and people in our lives for a reason. This life-changer was hanging out on my phone for years and showed up when I really needed. I deleted a lot of apps I got from Starbucks but never this one. ð¤"

            "Review": "I had high hopes for Happify, but, so far, itâs stressing me out. Imposing deadlines I never meant to put in myself by challenging me to do something nice for someone is stressful. The words in the âupliftâ game that are supposed to be empowering and uplifting are sometimes actually unattainable ideals and/or things some people donât aspire to (I donât want to be âperky,â for instance. Thatâs not my personality. I am happy, and pleasant, and even outgoing, but not perky).  Some people reading these words wonât feel uplifted so much as invalidated. Words like âpeace,â âcalmâ and âupliftâ were fine. When the game got too cluttered, again, it was just stressful, because I couldnât read anything. The reminders from Happify of what I am supposed to be doing on the app, the little icon that shows my mood, and tools that measure my progress ~ all of this would be great, if it was designed to make sure the user easily maintained upward movement, but itâs not. Itâs all extremely pressuring and stressful, in my opinion. It feels more like a challenge I am trying to meet than an app that is supposed to help me feel better."

            "Review": "Iâve had this app since Beta-testing it a few years ago. I donât typically use apps like this because most donât seem to have real direction or a variety that fits. I let this one sit for a bit before coming back to it during a stressful period, and I was pleasantly surprised! I like that I can extend my tracks now considering I donât come back here everyday, and the personalization is dead on for me! It goes hand in hand with where Iâve needed to grow yet lacked a clue where to start. My therapist very much approved too! Iâve since âgraduatedâ trauma-informed therapy, and this app has helped me in moments Iâve needed to simply be reminded of my newer mental toolbox. It doesnât overstep any spiritual boundaries for me either (Iâm a pastor). Thanks!!!"
